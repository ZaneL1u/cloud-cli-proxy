description: "Auto-fix issues found by code review in REVIEW.md. Spawns fixer agent, commits each fix atomically, produces REVIEW-FIX.md summary."

<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-code-review-fix` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Auto-fix issues found by code review. Reads REVIEW.md from the specified phase, spawns gsd-code-fixer agent to apply fixes, and produces REVIEW-FIX.md summary.

Arguments:
- Phase number (required) — which phase's REVIEW.md to fix (e.g., "2" or "02")
- `--all` (optional) — include Info findings in fix scope (default: Critical + Warning only)
- `--auto` (optional) — enable fix + re-review iteration loop, capped at 3 iterations

Output: {padded_phase}-REVIEW-FIX.md in phase directory + inline summary of fixes applied
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.cursor/get-shit-done/workflows/code-review-fix.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Phase: {{GSD_ARGS}} (first positional argument is phase number)

Optional flags parsed from {{GSD_ARGS}}:
- `--all` — Include Info findings in fix scope. Default behavior fixes Critical + Warning only.
- `--auto` — Enable fix + re-review iteration loop. After applying fixes, re-run code-review at same depth. If new issues found, iterate. Cap at 3 iterations total. Without this flag, single fix pass only.

Context files (.cursor/rules/, REVIEW.md, phase state) are resolved inside the workflow via `gsd-sdk query init.phase-op` and delegated to agent via config blocks.
</context>

<process>
This command is a thin dispatch layer. It parses arguments and delegates to the workflow.

Execute the code-review-fix workflow from @.cursor/get-shit-done/workflows/code-review-fix.md end-to-end.

The workflow (not this command) enforces these gates:
- Phase validation (before config gate)
- Config gate check (workflow.code_review)
- REVIEW.md existence check (error if missing)
- REVIEW.md status check (skip if clean/skipped)
- Agent spawning (gsd-code-fixer)
- Iteration loop (if --auto, capped at 3 iterations)
- Result presentation (inline summary + next steps)
</process>
