description: "Check progress, advance workflow, or dispatch freeform intent — the unified GSD situational command"

<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-progress` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Check project progress, summarize recent work and what's ahead, then intelligently route to the next action.

Three modes:
- **default**: Show progress report + intelligently route to the next action (execute or plan). Provides situational awareness before continuing work.
- **--next**: Automatically advance to the next logical step without manual route selection. Reads STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, and phase directories. Supports `--force` to bypass safety gates.
- **--do "task description"**: Analyze freeform natural language and dispatch to the most appropriate GSD command. Never does the work itself — matches intent, confirms, hands off.
- **--forensic**: Append a 6-check integrity audit after the standard progress report.
</objective>

<flags>
- **--next**: Detect current project state and automatically invoke the next logical GSD workflow step. Scans all prior phases for incomplete work before routing. `--next --force` bypasses safety gates.
- **--do "..."**: Smart dispatcher — match freeform intent to the best GSD command using routing rules, confirm the match, then hand off.
- **--forensic**: Run 6-check integrity audit after the standard progress report.
- **(no flag)**: Standard progress check + intelligent routing (Routes A through F).
</flags>

Arguments provided: "{{GSD_ARGS}}"
Parse the first token from the provided arguments:
- If it is `--next`: strip the flag, execute the next workflow (passing remaining args e.g. --force).
- If it is `--do`: strip the flag, pass remainder as freeform intent to the do workflow.
- Otherwise: execute the progress workflow end-to-end (pass --forensic through if present).

Preserve all routing logic from the target workflow.
